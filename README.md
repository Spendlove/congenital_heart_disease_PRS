# congenital_heart_disease_PRS

This github repository contains key code from my congenital heart disease PRS project.  For additional code or questions please contact me at spendlove.sj at gmail.com

Code for running PRSice-2 is in the cc_prs and sev_prs directories

Software is copied to the folder of the same name, but you may have to reinstall them.

Code to generate pseudo-controls in plink is included in the pseudo_controls folder.

Any other random scripts or information I decide to upload here in relation to this project is in the other folder. Currently it contains a script indicating how I obtained the positions of the genes from the  fetal cardiac gene set. I started with 18421 gene names and ended with 14167 non sex chromosome and non MT genes whose positions were available in Gencode version 35 annotations.
